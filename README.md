## Description

**PartyMe** is a mod that was created for the game DayZ created by *Bohemia Interractive*. The language used is Enforce script.

"It is an Object-Oriented Scripting Language (OOP) that works with objects and classes and is similar to C# programming language."
[Quote used, and wiki for syntax reference](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DayZ:Enforce_Script_Syntax)

The principle of the mod is based on the functionality of creating a group with other players and being able to keep a visual trace of them in real time.
There will be dynamic markers that show the position of a group member, as well as the distance they have to travel to get there. Including a HUD to keep an eye on their health.
